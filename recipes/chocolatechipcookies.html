    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked; they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
